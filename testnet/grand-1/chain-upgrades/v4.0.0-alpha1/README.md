# `v4.0.0` â€” argon<sup>86</sup> Upgrade

## Description

This proposal will perform a software upgrade of the Noble `grand-1` testnet chain to the [`v4.0.0-alpha1`](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/noble/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha1) release. The upgrade is planned for block [`2142000`](https://testnet.mintscan.io/noble-testnet/blocks/2142000), estimated to occur on Wed, July 19th, around 17 UTC. This time is not exact as block times vary, so please monitor the chain for the exact upgrade time.

This upgrade includes significant changes, namely adding a Circle CCTP module and a Router module. For a more in-depth description, please check out the [release notes](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/noble/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha1) and well as the [full changelog](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/noble/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0-alpha1).

## Upgrade Instructions

Once the upgrade height has been reached, your validator will throw a consensus error showing that a new binary is needed to perform the upgrade. It is recommended that you use the release artifacts, either the [docker image](ghcr.io/strangelove-ventures/noble:v4.0.0-alpha1) or the [binary](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/noble/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha1) depending on your infrastructure.

Verifying the checksum of your binary is crucial to ensure you're running the correct version.
