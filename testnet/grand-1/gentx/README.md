## Permissioned Network  
Noble is a permissioned network. Unlike permissionless Proof of Stake chains, the only way of participating in the Noble testnet is through a delegation of staking tokens by the Noble Maintenance Multisig (NMM). 

 Weâ€™re currently capped for participation and chose validators based on number of factors including 
- Running validator on Cosmos Hub 
- Geographic distribution of nodes 
- Community contributions (educational content, events/marketing presence, etc) 
- Infrastructure development (block explorers, wallets, core Cosmos stack development, testing, etc) 
- Significant ATOM stake (1%+ voting power)

We will reach out in the future if we're looking to expand the val set.
