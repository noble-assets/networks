# Grand Rehearsal 1

The Noble Core Team is conducting a testnet rehearsal in coordination with both the [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems) and [Hypha](https://hypha.coop) teams. These rehearsals are to test Noble's migration from a standalone Proof of Authority (PoA) chain to a consumer chain. All current validators of the `grand-1` network are automatically included in this rehearsal network and expected to spin up the necessary infrastructure.
